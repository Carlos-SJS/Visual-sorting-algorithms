# Visual-sorting-algorithms
This repository includes the visual representation of some common sorting algorithms, all of these reprecentations where made using processing

Is important to note that only swaps or changes to the array get shown, wich means the time that will take to run this visualizations depends on the swap efficiency of the algorthms and not their real efficiency

There are also included some visual searching algorithms.
